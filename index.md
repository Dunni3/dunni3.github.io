My name is Ian Dunn. I am a first-year student in the [Joint Carnegie Mellon - University of Pittsburgh PhD program in Computational Biology](http://www.compbio.cmu.edu). [David Koes](http://bits.csb.pitt.edu/) is my advisor. I am interested in developing machine learning methods for predicting and understanding molecular structure-property relationships, with an emphasis on using such methods for accelerating drug discovery. 

I graduated from Rowan University in 2019 with a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering. Before attending graduate school, I worked as an Associate Scientist at [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/) for two years.
