My name is Ian Dunn. I am a third year PhD student in the [Joint Carnegie Mellon - University of Pittsburgh PhD program in Computational Biology](http://www.compbio.cmu.edu). [David Koes](http://bits.csb.pitt.edu/) is my advisor. I am broadly interested in developing machine learning methods which operate directly on 3D molecular structures. My current work is focused on [deep generative models for structure-based drug design](/projects/keypoint_diffusion/). Specfically, I'm interested in improving diffusion and diffusion-like models for molecules as well as exploring the theoretical connections between neural SDEs and molecular dynamics. I also work on [applied drug discovery projects](/projects/cache); I've participated in two of the CACHE challenges and succesfully disocvered multiple experimentally valdiated hit compounds and some "potential hits" which are still being tested.  

I graduated from Rowan University in 2019 with a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering. Before attending graduate school, I worked as an Associate Scientist at [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/) for two years.
