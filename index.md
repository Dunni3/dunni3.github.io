My name is Ian Dunn. I am a second year student in the [Joint Carnegie Mellon - University of Pittsburgh PhD program in Computational Biology](http://www.compbio.cmu.edu). [David Koes](http://bits.csb.pitt.edu/) is my advisor. I am broadly interested in developing novel machine learning methods which operate directly on 3D molecular structures and can be used to accelerate drug discovery. More specifically, my current work is focused on deep generative models for structure-based drug design.

I graduated from Rowan University in 2019 with a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering. Before attending graduate school, I worked as an Associate Scientist at [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/) for two years.
