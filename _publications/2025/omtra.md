abstract: >-
  Structure-based drug design (SBDD) focuses on designing small-molecule ligands that bind to specific protein pockets. We propose a unified approach in OMTRA, a multi-modal flow matching model that flexibly performs many tasks relevant to SBDD, including de novo design, molecular docking, and pharmacophore-conditioned generation. OMTRA obtains state-of-the-art performance on pocket-conditioned de novo design and docking. Additionally, we curate a dataset of 500M 3D molecular conformers, complementing protein-ligand data and expanding the chemical diversity available for training.
