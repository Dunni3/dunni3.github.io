abstract: >-
  We present a machine learning approach to enhance structure-based drug discovery by generating three-dimensional pharmacophores using diffusion models. Rather than producing individual molecules, our method creates pharmacophore queries—spatial representations of protein-ligand interaction points—that can rapidly screen existing molecular databases for valid, commercially available compounds.
