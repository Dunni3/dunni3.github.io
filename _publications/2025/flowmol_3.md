  We present FlowMol3, a flow matching model that pushes the state of the art in unconditional 3D de novo small-molecule generation. FlowMol3 achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer learnable parameters than comparable methods.
