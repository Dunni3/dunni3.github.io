  In this work we benchmark the performance of existing discrete
  flow matching methods for 3D de novo small molecule generation and provide
  explanations of their differing behavior. As a result we present FlowMol-CTMC,
  an open-source model that achieves state of the art performance for 3D de novo
  design with fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. Additionally, we
  propose the use of metrics that capture molecule quality beyond local chemical
  valency constraints and towards higher-order structural motifs.
