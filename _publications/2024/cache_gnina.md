    We describe our winning submission to the first Critical Assessment of Computational Hit-Finding Experiments (CACHE) challenge. Our screening campaign was largely built around gnina, an open-source molecular docking program developed by the Koes lab that uses a deep-learning based scoring function. Our resulting best hit series tied for first place when evaluated by a panel of expert judges.
